### Game Rules Summary

**1. Grid & Entities**
*   **World:** A 2D grid (default 50x50).
*   **Entities:**
    *   **Workers:** Agents controlled by the solver/player. Size: 2x2 tiles.
    *   **Rocks:** Objects to be moved. Size: 2x2 tiles. Rocks do not block worker movement.
    *   **Exits:** Goal areas. Size: 2x2 tiles.
    *   **Tiles:**
        *   **Air:** Empty space.
        *   **Foreground (Walls):** Hard obstacles. **Impassable** (cannot be moved into). Blocks gravity.
        *   **Platform (Semi-Solid):** "Mario-style" platforms. **Permeable** (can be jumped through from below or dropped through from above) but provide support to stand on.
        *   **Climbable:** Ladders/Vines. Permeable. Resets jump power when touched.

**2. Gravity & Physics**
*   **Gravity:** Applied every frame to Workers and Rocks.
    *   Objects fall 1 tile down per frame.
*   **Support (Landing):** An object stops falling if:
    *   The tiles immediately below it are **Solid** (either `Foreground` or `Platform`).
    *   It is resting on another supported object (stacking).
*   **Exceptions:**
    *   **Rocks:** Do not fall if "tied" to a Rope.
    *   **Workers:** Do not fall if they have remaining `jumpPower`.

**3. Worker Movement**
*   **Walk:** Move Left (`-1, 0`) or Right (`1, 0`).
*   **Descend:** Move Down (`0, -1`). Valid unless the target is `Foreground`.
    *   *Note:* This allows workers to voluntarily drop down through `Platform` tiles.
*   **Jump:** Requires `jumpPower > 0`.
    *   Move Up (`0, 1`), Up-Left (`-1, 1`), or Up-Right (`1, 1`).
    *   *Note:* Workers can jump strictly **up through** `Platform` tiles because they are not "Unpathable."
*   **Jump Mechanics:**
    *   Workers have a `jumpPower` stat (Max: 4).
    *   `jumpPower` decreases by 1 each frame the worker is airborne/jumping.
    *   `jumpPower` resets to Max (4) when the worker is supported by solid ground (Foreground *or* Platform) or is touching a `Climbable` tile.

**4. Rock Interaction (Pushing)**
*   **Direct Interaction:** Workers **can** push rocks.
    *   **Cost:** Pushing rocks takes many more ticks than walking or using a moving platform.
*   **Indirect Interaction:** Workers move rocks by activating mechanisms:
    *   **Conveyor Belts:**
        *   Workers perform an `Activate` action on the belt.
        *   Moves all rocks resting on the belt 1 tile horizontally (direction defined by the belt).
    *   **Ropes (RopeOnAxle):**
        *   Workers perform an `Activate` action to extend/retract the rope or tie a rock.
        *   **Tying:** If the rope is fully extended and overlaps a rock, the rock becomes "tied".
        *   **Lifting:** Retracting the rope moves the tied rock up. Extending it moves the rock down.

**5. Objectives**
*   **Win Condition:** A Rock overlaps with an Exit tile.
*   **Fail Condition:** A Worker or Rock enters an "Unpathable" tile (e.g., crushed inside a wall/moving platform).
